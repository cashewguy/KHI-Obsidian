# Selective Kindle Highlight Importer

This is a very quick-and-dirty plugin adapted from the Sample Plugin with the help of ChatGPT (I am not a real developer, barely a fake one).

Basically, I used to use Goodreads and Kindle to get my highlights. But they've started truncating these, which really irritated me. I wanted something that'd fit into my Obsidian flow, which when I am writing book reviews means a Notes section with all my highlights. I went back and forth with GPT and experimented a bit myself to get this. If anyone wants to improve it, that is wonderful.

There are some other Kindle highlight importers, but they were all en masse, whereas I only wanted the import for specific titles.

You will need to clone your My Clippings.txt from your kindle and into a folder in your vault. I used Clippings/My Clippings.txt. You will need to put the path in the settings.

From there, when you're in a note, you can open up command palette and search "Kindle" and it should pop up with the selective highlight import. It'll let you fuzzy search your books for the one you want, on enter it'll paste the highlights where your cursor is.
